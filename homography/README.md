## Introduction

* This code computes the homography transformation between the input image plane and the target image plane, then produces the output image using the computed homography.
* The homography is solved based on DLT.
* Eigen is used for matrix and SVD computation.
* OpenCV is used for image rendering.

## Input and Output

* Input: data/rainbow.jpg is taken with an oblique view.
* Output: (generated by the code) output/homographyImage-DLT.png is the virtual top-down view of the input image.

<img src="data/rainbow.jpg" width="300" />
<img src="output/homographyImage-DLT.png" width="300" />

## Build and Run Command

```
chmod +x build.sh
